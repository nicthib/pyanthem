Installation
============
Note: If you do not have working installations of the above listed requirements, it is strongly recommended that you use miniconda_/Anaconda_ for a straightforward installation process. If you do not have either, miniconda is preferred as it is a faster install and takes up much less space.

If you do have the above requirements installed, you can simply install pyanthem using pip: :code:`pip install pyanthem`

Using Miniconda/Anaconda:
-------------------------

Create an environment and install the required packages::

    conda create -n pyanthem python=3.7 pip ffmpeg fluidsynth --channel conda-forge --channel nicthib

Next, activate the environment::

   conda activate pyanthem

Finally, install the pyanthem Python package using pip::
   
   pip install pyanthem
