Description: ***********************************************************************
        pyanthem: an audiovisualization tool to make your data more interesting
        ***********************************************************************
        
        pyanthem is a Python_ tool that transforms three-dimensional time-varying datasets into a colorful, audible format. pyanthem boasts a variety of features: 
        
        1) Raw data decomposition
        2) Video and audio preview
        3) A broad variety of video and audio parameters
        4) Command-line reproduction via config files
        
        Requirements
        ============
        Python 3:
           Currently, pyanthem is tested to work on Python_ 3.7+. This will be 
           updated as more versions are tested.
        
        pip:
           pip is needed for the installation of the pyanthem module and its
           dependencies.  Most python versions will have pip installed already, 
           see the  `pip installation`_ page for instructions if you do not 
           have pip.
        
        ffmpeg:
           ffmpeg_ enables video creation and merging.
        
        fluidsynth (optional, but **highly recommended**)
           fluidsynth_ is a powerful software synthesizer, which enables 
           conversion of data to crisp, high quality sound files.
        
        git (optional):
          git_ allows pyanthem to download external audio files quickly and 
          easily.

        Installation
        ============
        Note: If you do not have working versions of the above listed 
        requirements, it is recommended that you use miniconda_ or Anaconda_ for a
        straightforward installation process.
        
        Using Miniconda/Anaconda:
        ----------------
        
        First, download the `pyanthem.yaml`_ config file. 
        Create the environment by navigating to the pyanthem.yaml file's location, 
        and then by running::
        
           conda env create -f pyanthem.yaml
        
        Next, activate the environment::
        
           conda activate pyanthem
           
        Using pip
        ---------
        
        If you already have the requirements installed, install pyanthem using pip::
        
           python -m pip install pyanthem
